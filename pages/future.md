## Current Environment - Understanding Flow and ve(3,3)

Only `FLOW` that is locked as `veFLOW` can be used to vote. To understand more on the mechanics of `veFLOW` refer to the section [Protocol Overview](/protocol)


## Future Plans

Velocimeter started as a fork of Velodrome and has since evolved into a project that aims at offering a bit more then a traditional Velo fork. 
To help our users understand this we have created this document. So let's get right to it and talk about some of the future changes that we will be deploying to make our fork stand out.


1. 1:1 airdrop on next chain (similar to velodrome airdropping OP to lockers)
1. OTC veFLOW and use funds to buy back FLOW to LP in flow pairs to deepen our liquidity and lower our slippage.
1. Continue to onboarding new partners that commit to bribing & bring volume to our dex
1. Reduce pairs with the addition of multihop
1. Increase APR on FLOW pairs to deepen liquidity
1. Make voting more attractive by clearly communicating and sticking to a system of voting with team & protocol NFTs

## 1:1 Airdrops

As the Velocimeter team continues to grow it's offerings we will be slowly launching our products into different ecosystems. 
As each new ecosystem comes online we will need veFLOW voters to help determine APY and emissions for the new pools. 
To achieve this goal we intened to reward early veFLOW lockers with 1:1 veFLOW airdrops on newly launched chains. 
This will ensure that as we launch new chains our existing lockers will gain valuable governance roles in the new chains we launch. This is very important for our protocol to grow.

## OTC veFLOW offerings

With small marketcap ecosystems large buys and sells can often have even larger affects on the price of the underlying token. 
To help combat this we intend to offer OTC options for buying and selling veFLOW NFT's to newly onboarded partners or others looking to gain more control over governance.
These OTC offerings will be in the form of veFLOW NFTs that directly correlates back to locked FLOW that is being used for voting. 
With the liquidity gained from these OTC sales we will buy back FLOW on the open market and lock it into the Liquidity Pools to help deepen our liquidity and lower our slippage during large buys.

## Onboarding New Partners

One of the lowest hanging fruits in a newly and undeveloped ecosystem is lowering the barrier to entry for new partners to move into our chain. 
By leveraging our chain leading tech offerings we have identified numerous ecosystem partners that once onboarded will commit to briding our veFLOW voters and bringing larger volume to our dex to help boost fees.
As we meticulously role out new partners over the next few quarters you will continue to see more bribes and more volume which will directly benefit all veFLOW lockers and governance voters.

## Reducing pairs with addition of multihop

Mulihop swapping is extremely important for a full dex ecosystem offering like we are building. The reason for that is without multihop swapping swaps are only possible between direct pool pairs. 
For example if you wanted to swap from FLOW to CINU you would require for example a FLOW/NOTE pool to sell your FLOW for NOTE and then a NOTE/CINU pool to sell your NOTE and buy CINU. 
This would require multiple swaps for the user and many more Liquidity Pools spreading APY for each pool. With the addition of Mulihop any user of our dex will be able to swap directly between any two assets supported by Velocimeter.
The new interface will allow this by automatically suggestion routes (while prioritizing the most efficient route). This allows us to concentrate the amount of LP pools and maximizing the rewards for those pools without it being determinental to our user experience.

## Increase APR on FLOW pairs

With the addition of multihop we get the ability to limit the amount of FLOW pools which paradoxically allows us to maximize the APR for the FLOW pools that do exist.
This small change along with the introduction of Multihop will have big impact on our users overall APR. We know APR is important to our users and this is why we have prioritized adding Multihop.

## Clarity of the benefits of Voting

One of the often misunderstood things about the ve(3,3) model is the importance of and the overall benefit to the user for joining the lockers and helping in the governance. 
With this model the veFLOW lockers are the ones that are determining the APR for the pools and helping to control the future of the protocol. 
This requires weekly voting and commitment to staying on top of new pools and bribes coming in to draw your votes to these pools. 
To pay our users back for this effort and commitment we want to maximize the ROI on their efforts by continuously providing clear direction as to how the team and protocol voting will go so that users can develope their own voting strategies that don't end up in conflict with the teams votes due to lack of clarity.
A ve(3,3) dex is only as strong as it's voting particpants and for this reason we want all our voters to feel they have clear direction from us on how we will vote with protocol votes and team votes. This clarity should enable our voters to make better decisions that will lead to better rewards for their efforts.
