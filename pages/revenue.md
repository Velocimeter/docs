# Protocol Revenue
An important part of any project is the ability to sustain it's costs. Velocimeter has put a good amount of thought into making sure that the team, and community
has a sustainable source of revenue.

## Swap Fees
All trading fees from liquidity pools that don't have gauges will be sent to the `tank`. Once a gauge is created for a particular pool, this feature is disabled. 
These fees will be used at the discretion of the team to do various things, ie FLOW token buybacks and burns, bribe various core pools, pay for developments...

## Protocol Owned Voting Power (POVP)
The voting power of protocol will be used to vote on various pool, but dominantly on `FLOW:USDC` or any core `FLOW` pool. Bribes collected via voting on the `FLOW` pools will be used to deepen Protocol Owned Liquidity

## Protocol Owned Liquidity
The `FLOW` rewards collected on `FLOW:USDC` will be fully locked to increase the POVP. 

## Team Emissions
3% of the emissions are sent to the treasury. These `FLOW` tokens will be used for various things at the discretion of the team to do various things, ie FLOW token buybacks and burns, bribe various core pools, pay for developments, add to team member voting power...

## Team Voting
Each team member has their own personal `veFLOW` and they can vote as they please to attempt to generate their own source of income.
