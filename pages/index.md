Velocimeter, at its core, is a solution for protocols on [Arbitrum](https://www.Arbitrum.io/) to properly incentivize liquidity for their own use cases.
Building on top of the groundwork laid out by Solidly, our team has addressed that first iteration's core issues to realize its full potential.

## Where does this project come from?
Velocimeter is a project built based on the orignal designs of [Andre Cronje's Solidly](https://andrecronje.medium.com/ve-3-3-44466eaa088b) which was later revised and made wildly successful by [Velodrome Finance](https://app.velodrome.finance/). 

## WTF is a velocimeter?
[Velocimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocimetry) is the measurement of the velocity of fluids. A velocimeter is a tool that is used to measure the velocity and lenghts of movements. We felt this name accurately described what is happening in an AMM with tokens; "Liquidity" is added, moved around, and "flows" in and out of it.
