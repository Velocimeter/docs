## Getting Ready

Velocimeter operates exclusively on the Arbitrum network.

If you are unfamiliar with Arbitrum, you can find a lot of resources
about the network, its ecosystem, and its mission on the Arbitrum website
https://www.Arbitrum.io

To set up your wallet, please go to https://chainlist.org and search for
_Arbitrum_. You can use the _Connect Wallet_ button to automatically configure
your default wallet to use Arbitrum. Use the _arrow down_ to expand for more
configuration options.

## Bridging

New Arbitrum users who want to participate in Velocimeter should make sure they
have `$ETH` on Arbitrum in order to be able to pay for transaction/gas fees.

Bridging to Arbitrum is possible here: [Arbitrum Bridge](https://app.Arbitrum.io/bridge).
You can also bridge via [Multichain](https://app.multichain.org/#/router) or [Bungee](https://www.bungee.exchange/)

<Callout emoji='⚠️'>
  Some bridging services can take up to 20-30 minutes to complete a transfer of
  the assets. Velocimeter doesn't guarantee the results of any of the bridges.
  Issue with bridges are best taken up with the respective communities of those
  bridges.
